  # A clean upgrade/uninstall must stop everything the app spawns. Homebrew runs
  # these in a fixed order (quit before script), so:
  #   1. quit the GUI by bundle id — this triggers the app's own graceful daemon
  #      shutdown (divoomd exits, releasing /tmp/divoom.sock).
  #   2. pkill the helper binaries — the menu-bar agent is spawned detached
  #      (start_new_session) and orphans to launchd when the GUI quits, so it must
  #      be killed explicitly; this also reaps a stubborn divoomd. The pattern
  #      matches only Contents/Frameworks/bin/divoom{d,-menubar}, never the main
  #      Contents/MacOS/Divoom app. `|| true` so a no-match (nothing running) is
  #      not treated as a failure.
